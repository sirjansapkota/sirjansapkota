### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on application of quantitative genetics in hybrid breeding. The goals are to optimize training population design for prediction of hybrid performance and combining abilities of parent lines. I am also working on high throughput phenotyping platforms (near infrared spectroscopy and imaging using UAV) and their integration into breeding pipeline.

Below is my brief resume:
